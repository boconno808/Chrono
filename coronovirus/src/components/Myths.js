            Because the coronavirus started in Wuhan China, many people think that only asians have the virus.

            It is not recommended that people who are well wear a mask to protect themselves from COVID-19 unless a healthcare professional advises it.
            Only those affected and those helping the affected need to wear a N95 mask.
